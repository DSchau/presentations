Gatsby is fast. You know this—it’s probably what drew you to Gatsby in the first place! But what you may not know is the numerous performance techniques that make Gatsby so fast and how we leverage these techniques to create a blazing fast experience for your users, by default. In this webinar recording, you’ll learn about a number of modern performance techniques including route-based code splitting, image optimization, prefetching of routes with intersection observers, and more! Each of these techniques coupled together delivers the blazing fast experience you know and expect in a Gatsby application.

## What you'll learn

- Gatsby’s usage of SSR (Server Side Rendering) and why it matters
- Route-based code splitting and how it works
- Gatsby’s use of modern APIs and how they enable the blazing-fast apps your users expect
- Pragmatic techniques for asserting that your app is actually fast
